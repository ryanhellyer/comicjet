Tutorial:
	unavoidable - happens on viewing your first comic

Save:
	store last page info and fades out read comics on home page and highlights last one in reading

Nina and F
	Remove comics on first page
		Show background image with person reading tablet
		On click "Get started" (changed from begin learning), start tutorial
	Home page
		Maybe move comic title above image
		Maybe make thumbnails less tall
	Make comics skinnier at desktop

Annika,
	Title in comics should be smaller
	Logo is shit 
	Get started button is diffidence shape

Nginx redirect all old comic URLs to the new ones
	ie: http://comicjet.com/en/de/breaking-all-barriers/71/ goes to http://comicjet.com/en/de/breaking-all-barriers/#71

Finish "back to comic selection page" button on each comic.
	also needs translated
