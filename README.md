Comic Jet language learning application


TODO:

/ - home page
	Remove redirect
	Force user to enter language selection to reach actual page
	Get ordering from list


/en/bla/ should trigger 404

/en/de/comic/ - comic page
	Need to have ability to display credits beneath each comic



Suggestions from others:
	Swipe to next comic
	Big arrows on left and right sides, to allow easier transition to next page
	More information about how to navigate, ie: arrow keys are not obvious
	When someone clicks another comic, I could make it pop open a box which said "Would you like to try a tutorial first? Yes/No".
