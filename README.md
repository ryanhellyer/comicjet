Suggestions from others:
	Swipe to next comic
	More information about how to navigate, ie: arrow keys are not obvious
	When someone clicks another comic, I could make it pop open a box which said "Would you like to try a tutorial first? Yes/No".
	Translate to arabic
		ask for translators on Nina's FB page
		ask for translators English -> German for other comics
		ask Gaia authors for permission to translate their comics

Next arrow appears on last page - it shouldn't.

"Next" -> "Next page"
			"Nexte Seite"
	- could be confused with "Next comic"

Page 9/X - need to know how many pages are left.


Translate:
	'de' => 'And another other German text goes here',
	'de' => 'Some German text goes here',
