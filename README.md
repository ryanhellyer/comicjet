Suggestions from others:
	Swipe to next comic
	When someone clicks another comic, I could make it pop open a box which said "Would you like to try a tutorial first? Yes/No".
	Translate to arabic
		ask for translators on Nina's FB page
		ask for translators English -> German for other comics
		ask Gaia authors for permission to translate their comics

co-up
	Remove tutorial button and icon
	On clicking "Start learning" go to tutorial
		Or, on clicking comic go to tutorial
	Red tutorial text should be above tutorial
	"Go to tutorial" button should be gone.

Nina and F
	Tutorial - remove all buttons
		Giant text, with bare instructions
			Below is the comic
	Remove comics on first page
		Show background image with person reading tablet
		On click "Get started" (changed from begin learning), start tutorial
	Center the arrows on the screen, rather than centered on image
	Home page
		Maybe move comic title above image
		Maybe make thumbnails less tall
	Make comics skinnier at desktop

Annika,
	Title in comics should be smaller
	Logo is shit 
	Get started button is diffidence shape
	Next prev buttons word positioning in comparison to title
	Title and page 9/93 should be on same line. Don't center on middle.



Translate:
	'de' => 'And another other German text goes here',
	'de' => 'Some German text goes here',
	"Previous seite" => not sure 'previous' is a German word
