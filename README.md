Main comic is creative commons ... http://www.jesusandmo.net/images/jesusogmosmags.pdf (Jesus and Mo)

Tutorial:
	unavoidable - happens on viewing your first comice

Save:
	store last page info and fades out read comics on home page and highlights last one in reading

Annika,
	Title in comics should be smaller
	Get started button is diffidence shape

Maybe scroll to top button means that header needs to stay fixed, even on mobile?

Nginx redirect all old comic URLs to the new ones
	ie: http://comicjet.com/en/de/breaking-all-barriers/71/ goes to http://comicjet.com/en/de/breaking-all-barriers/#71

Finish "back to comic selection page" button on each comic.
	also needs translated

Tutorial:

Have text which shows, then disappears once they've clicked comic. It stays fixed to bottom of page rather than bottom of comic, so that it's always present.


Huge radial circle, heart beat in middle.

"Tap to switch languages"

Have it stay on every single comic, until clicked.

On desktop: follow mouse cursor perhaps.
