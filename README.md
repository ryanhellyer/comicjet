Suggestions from others:
	Swipe to next comic
	When someone clicks another comic, I could make it pop open a box which said "Would you like to try a tutorial first? Yes/No".
	Translate to arabic
		ask for translators on Nina's FB page
		ask for translators English -> German for other comics
		ask Gaia authors for permission to translate their comics

Personal experience:
	Need keyboard access to switch language.
		Perhaps ENTER. SPACE is already used for page down.

Next arrow appears on last page - it shouldn't.

"Next" -> "Next page"
			"Nexte Seite"
	- could be confused with "Next comic"


Translate:
	'de' => 'And another other German text goes here',
	'de' => 'Some German text goes here',
	"Previous seite" => not sure 'previous' is a German word
