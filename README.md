Main comic is creative commons ... http://www.jesusandmo.net/images/jesusogmosmags.pdf (Jesus and Mo)

Nginx redirect all old comic URLs to the new ones
	ie: http://comicjet.com/en/de/breaking-all-barriers/71/ goes to http://comicjet.com/en/de/breaking-all-barriers/#71

Finish "back to comic selection page" button on each comic.
	also needs translated


Convert file formats:
mogrify -format jpg /home/ryan/vagrant/VVV/www/dev.comicjet.com/public/comics/xkcd1/*.png



Add new menu item:
	Need "Main menu" button, so that users can obviously get from comic back to main page again.
	Maybe don't show on mobile, but get users to test it to ensure they can find their way back.


Language selector:
	Change to single select box, otherwise people click "learn german" and nothing happens.
