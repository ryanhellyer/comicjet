Suggestions from others:
	Swipe to next comic
	More information about how to navigate, ie: arrow keys are not obvious
	When someone clicks another comic, I could make it pop open a box which said "Would you like to try a tutorial first? Yes/No".
	Translate to arabic
		ask for translators on Nina's FB page
		ask for translators English -> German for other comics
		ask Gaia authors for permission to translate their comics

Next arrow appears on last page - it shouldn't.

"Next" -> "Next page"
			"Nexte Seite"
	- could be confused with "Next comic"

Page 9/X - need to know how many pages are left.


TUTORIAL
	When new visitor ...
	Show indicators to set language (but only if not on correct on already)
	Show indicator to click a specific comic and grey out all other comics
		use a comic with an obvious bit of text on the page to demo it - perhaps an XKCD one?
	Show indicator on page to say to click it to see the text change
		explain that the text will change language
	Hide the tutorial comic afterwards
	Perhaps make indicators pulsate via CSS
